Kippt Reading Companion (KRC)
============

I wanted a way to take notes while reading content on the web that was convenient and didn't interfere with my regular browsing experience. It turns out this is fairly challenging. Chrome extensions typically only make due with a very [limited](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pageAction.html) number of [available](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction.html) UI motifs. So I essentially made my own.

Built off of [ft-extension](https://github.com/kharmabum/ft-extension) template. How-to [install](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked).

Keyboard shortcuts:
  - default: Ctrl+Shift+K
  - mac: Command+Shift+K
